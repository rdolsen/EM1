    <h1>In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
    <h2>by Hito Steyerl</h2>
    <p>
        What gives an image value? Is it simply its resolution? Perhaps to a media distributor looking to commodify and profit from an image, high-quality, high-resolution images are of higher value than those not as clear. Much like the many other hierarchies that exist under capitalism, the hierarchy of images is one that those who stand to profit the most from the proliferation and commodification of images demand we subscribe to. The reality is that the poor image, one that may have been recycled and reformatted by many digital users, holds its own value outside a strict hierarchy.</p>
<p>Mass appeal is not always what we are told to look at that sells the most or earns the most clicks, but it can come from homegrown sources that simply seek to spread information or ideas and receive attention. By enforcing a hierarchy that seeks to amplify only what seems most widely and visually appealing, we may miss out on art and ideas that push boundaries and go against the mainstream. Whenever I hear about a movie studio making a decision to appeal to a global (Chinese) audience, I roll my eyes, knowing they are simply another business looking to make maximum profit rather than a creative workplace for artists to wholly express themselves.</p>
<p>Poor images do not inherently rebel against profit systems and occasionally can come directly from them. There was a recent online trend of producing anime-style images with generative AI, but because this new technology is imperfect, it began to spit out images saturated with yellow hues due to the constant recycling and reprompting of the same, low-quality images. These degradations cannot be credited to the digital comrades of the world but rather to the corporatization of digital tools. </p>
