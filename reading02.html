<h1>Second Reading Response</h1>
<p>This week's reading from Walter Benjamin found me reflecting on the art I grew up with in my own home. My father had an assortment of watercolor paints and brushes that he kept in a tackle box in our basement, revealing a hobby he had only had a loose attachment to. His paintings were kept in messy books, again stored away, not intended for an audience but for his own ritual of expression. In 2005, he reignited another passion of his that had been a more enthusiastic hobby, art photography, and started his own business selling prints of his nature and landscape work. He is not a fan of commercialization and never intended for his business to be a source of significant income, but found himself printing, matting, and framing his own work. His process was generally spontaneous and would be enveloped in his daily routine of immersing himself in the natural environment around us in northern New England. As an early riser, he would go on early morning walks or drives out into the farmlands that surrounded our small town, seeking the soft light and low contrast of the often foggy or snowy mornings. These conditions became fundamental aspects of his work and showed where his artistic eye thrived. As Benjamin states, “the unique value of the ‘authentic’ work of art has its basis in the ritual, the location of its original use value.” My father would get to work early, as the farmers do, and explore the sharp and straight lines of the barns in contrast with the rolling, curved slopes of the hilly farmland, and extract images that reexamine the surroundings most people in our small community see daily and take for granted. Throughout his process of perfecting his work, he found a preference for printing his images with minimal photo editing on watercolor paper, evoking an almost painterly quality with his images. This use of materials contributes to a captivating sense in his work that requires close textural examination, like that of a painting, and encourages viewers to examine the subjects that much more closely. In this way, I think he has harnessed the power of photography and its reproduction to invite people, even those local to New England, to immerse themselves deeper in the natural world we inhabit with newfound curiosity. Benjamin writes, “By close-ups of the things around us, by focusing on hidden details of familiar objects, by exploring common place milieus under the ingenious guidance of the camera, the film, on the one hand, extends our comprehension of the necessities which rule our lives; on the other hand, it manages to assure us of an immense and unexpected field of action.”
