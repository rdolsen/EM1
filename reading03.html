<h1>Third Reading Response</h1>
<p>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush once again has me reflecting on my familial connections to this piece. My great-uncle, Ken Olsen, grew up fixing radios and tinkering with electronics, so when he served in the US Navy at the tail end of World War 2, he worked as a radio engineer. After his service, he went to school at MIT and studied electronic engineering, eventually being recruited by the Office of Naval Research to create a flight simulator. He continued to work as an engineer in the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which is a DoD-funded research and development center focused on technological development for national security purposes. I have no doubt he would have been inspired by Vannervar Bush and this article, and may have even crossed paths with him. Ken went on to found a computer company in the late 50s with my grandfather, his brother, Stan, that would be successful for several decades. In 1977, Ken was quoted during a meeting saying, “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.” At the time, he was working with machines that were mainly used in business for data processing, called ‘mini computers,’ though they were really the size of refrigerators, and was discussing the use of computing automation of everyday things at home, such as switching lights on and off, regulating temperature, and the preparation of meals. While his intention was much more innocent, the quote was taken and sensationalized, categorizing him as anything but visionary, as a few years later, the likes of Steve Jobs and his personal computer came to prominence.
In many ways, I think the hard work and technological advancements made by my great-uncle and grandfather provided the ability for the future generations of their family to focus on creativity.</p>
