<h1>Eighth Reading Response</h1>
<p>Interactive storytelling is already a large swath of the current media landscape. Mostly seen in video games, though there have been attempts to mainstream interactive films like Netflix’s Bandersnatch, which ultimately most audiences felt was unsuccessful. In the sense that Murray writes, Bandersnatch was an additive creation using filmmaking and a choose-your-own-adventure style structure to create something that was not entirely brand new. In the end, the limitations of resources needed for filmmaking limit the expansive nature with which Murray talks about expressive forms, which is perhaps why digital interactive storytelling feels much more accessible with video games. The recent release Baldur’s Gate III is an example that comes to mind, with which the player, or audience, has much more ability to steer a storyline as they wish. While The Sims is spoken about as a prime example of interactivity and player choice, there are still the constraints of its attempts to simulate ‘real life.’ Baldur’s Gate is set in a fantasy world where the focus is much more on shaping whether you choose a villainous or heroic story arc for your character through many decisions and interactions throughout your journey, and your ability to choose to romance certain characters and make a nemesis of others makes the story much more customizable and immersive. Though, of course, there are still limitations. No game has yet created the ability to generate landscapes, assets, or character models that are not precreated for the specific game. I suppose the next step in making these interactive games a true expressive form will be with the integration of generative artificial intelligence. I’m sure in the near future we will begin to see games that market themselves as open-world builders, where you can choose to customize anything from the world setting to the exact physical makeup of characters without the predetermination of game developers, but instead with the integrated use of generative AI technology. One iteration or playthrough of your game could be in a fantasy world as a knight slaying dragons and rescuing damsels in distress, and then the next could be in a technodystopian future as an alien invading Earth. This would allow for a massive expansion in storytelling possibilities and would be closest to Murray’s idea of an expressive form, however, it wouldn’t exactly be a utopian development for a number of reasons. The integration of AI would eliminate a vast number of creative jobs that many people need and would require large amounts of energy to constantly be creating new digital environments and assets for each individual player. And while the idea of deeper immersion in media consumption is a draw for many of the capitalists behind the biggest producers of media these days, the thought of something of this scale makes me think consumers would sink deeper into digital isolation and become even more separated and fractured from the real physical world we live in.
