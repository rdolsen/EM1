<h1>Fifth Reading Response</h1>
<p>I have been reflecting on my own relationship with media while reading Enzenberger’s Constituents of a theory of the media. As a child growing up in a small town, I felt like media was my window to the world and how I could explore and understand the world before having access to the freedom of an adult. I found an insatiable curiosity for the world through media, and when I was able, I decided to step away from books and screens to explore and see it for myself. It was around this time that I started to become more critical of many of the preconceived narratives that had helped shape my world view. I became wary of narratives that sought to paint things as ‘dangerous’ and seek the deeper reasoning for the fear, quickly coming to understand many have their own agendas when shaping the stories they wish to tell. Though I was becoming more politically minded, I found myself often surrounded by people who were not as critical or curious about who shaped the narratives the public consumed and why. My undergraduate film program was in the school of communications, and I worked frequently alongside the broadcast journalism students at Quinnipiac University. I found it admirable that these students were interested in telling a fact based stories, but soon learned the truth was relative. Around 2016 (what happened that year?), I began to see that truth was not rigid like it’s definition would infer, but could be bent and shaped with enough power. Enzenberger’s notion that there is a liberal superstition of a pure, unmanipulated truth became an ironic truth in my eyes. I had lived most of my life believing that a majority believed in the hard truths like evolution, a spherical earth, vaccines save lives, but the revelation was that all things, even those observable with our own eyes, contain many different readings or narratives one could draw from them. I recently happened to be rewatching some of Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom on HBO, and the exact tensions described by Enzenberger were being played out. While there is a group of journalists nobly attempting to be as objectively informative and human focused as possible in their coverage, the heavy hand of their corporate owners seeks to steer the audience's focus in favor of their capitalist interests and maintaining a status quo. The free exchange of information and objectivity threatens those who seek to control the consciousness so they seek to maintain a system of non-reciprocal, false communication, that subjects the audience to be receivers only and little to no access to being in the position of transmitter.</p>
