    <h1>In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
    <h2>by Hito Steyerl</h2>
    <p>
        What gives an image value? Is it simply its resolution? Perhaps to a media distributor looking to commodify and profit from an image, high-quality, high-resolution images are of higher value than those not as clear. Much like the many other hierarchies that exist under capitalism, the hierarchy of images is one that those who stand to profit the most from the proliferation and commodification of images demand we subscribe to. The reality is that the poor image, one that may have been recycled and reformatted by many digital users, holds its own value outside a strict hierarchy.</p>
<p>Mass appeal is not always what we are told to look at that sells the most or earns the most clicks, but it can come from homegrown sources that simply seek to spread information or ideas and receive attention. By enforcing a hierarchy that seeks to amplify only what seems most widely and visually appealing, we may miss out on art and ideas that push boundaries and go against the mainstream. Whenever I hear about a movie studio making a decision to appeal to a global (Chinese) audience, I roll my eyes, knowing they are simply another business looking to make maximum profit rather than a creative workplace for artists to wholly express themselves.</p>
<p>Poor images do not inherently rebel against profit systems and occasionally can come directly from them. There was a recent online trend of producing anime-style images with generative AI, but because this new technology is imperfect, it began to spit out images saturated with yellow hues due to the constant recycling and reprompting of the same, low-quality images. These degradations cannot be credited to the digital comrades of the world but rather to the corporatization of digital tools. </p>

    <h1>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h1>
    <h2>by Walter Benjamin</h2>
    <p>
        This week's reading from Walter Benjamin found me reflecting on the art I grew up with in my own home. My father had an assortment of watercolor paints and brushes that he kept in a tackle box in our basement, revealing a hobby he had only had a loose attachment to. His paintings were kept in messy books, again stored away, not intended for an audience but for his own ritual of expression. In 2005, he reignited another passion of his that had been a more enthusiastic hobby, art photography, and started his own business selling prints of his nature and landscape work. He is not a fan of commercialization and never intended for his business to be a source of significant income, but found himself printing, matting, and framing his own work. His process was generally spontaneous and would be enveloped in his daily routine of immersing himself in the natural environment around us in northern New England. As an early riser, he would go on early morning walks or drives out into the farmlands that surrounded our small town, seeking the soft light and low contrast of the often foggy or snowy mornings. These conditions became fundamental aspects of his work and showed where his artistic eye thrived. As Benjamin states, “the unique value of the ‘authentic’ work of art has its basis in the ritual, the location of its original use value.” My father would get to work early, as the farmers do, and explore the sharp and straight lines of the barns in contrast with the rolling, curved slopes of the hilly farmland, and extract images that reexamine the surroundings most people in our small community see daily and take for granted. Throughout his process of perfecting his work, he found a preference for printing his images with minimal photo editing on watercolor paper, evoking an almost painterly quality with his images. This use of materials contributes to a captivating sense in his work that requires close textural examination, like that of a painting, and encourages viewers to examine the subjects that much more closely. In this way, I think he has harnessed the power of photography and its reproduction to invite people, even those local to New England, to immerse themselves deeper in the natural world we inhabit with newfound curiosity. Benjamin writes, “By close-ups of the things around us, by focusing on hidden details of familiar objects, by exploring common place milieus under the ingenious guidance of the camera, the film, on the one hand, extends our comprehension of the necessities which rule our lives; on the other hand, it manages to assure us of an immense and unexpected field of action.”

    <h1>As We May Think</h1>
    <h2>by Vannevar Bush</h2>
    <p>
        As We May Think by Vannevar Bush once again has me reflecting on my familial connections to this piece. My great-uncle, Ken Olsen, grew up fixing radios and tinkering with electronics, so when he served in the US Navy at the tail end of World War 2, he worked as a radio engineer. After his service, he went to school at MIT and studied electronic engineering, eventually being recruited by the Office of Naval Research to create a flight simulator. He continued to work as an engineer in the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which is a DoD-funded research and development center focused on technological development for national security purposes. I have no doubt he would have been inspired by Vannervar Bush and this article, and may have even crossed paths with him. Ken went on to found a computer company in the late 50s with my grandfather, his brother, Stan, that would be successful for several decades. In 1977, Ken was quoted during a meeting saying, “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.” At the time, he was working with machines that were mainly used in business for data processing, called ‘mini computers,’ though they were really the size of refrigerators, and was discussing the use of computing automation of everyday things at home, such as switching lights on and off, regulating temperature, and the preparation of meals. While his intention was much more innocent, the quote was taken and sensationalized, categorizing him as anything but visionary, as a few years later, the likes of Steve Jobs and his personal computer came to prominence.
In many ways, I think the hard work and technological advancements made by my great-uncle and grandfather provided the ability for the future generations of their family to focus on creativity.

    <h1>The Society of the Spectacle</h1>
    <h2>by Guy Debord</h2>
    <p>
        Our class readings so far have come from writers who lived before the technological revolution brought on by the advent of the internet, and yet they seem to have an eerie prescience of what our world would look like many decades later. Debord continues this by outlining spectacle in a way that seems a fitting description of our contemporary news and social media landscape. The emergence of 24-hour news television meant that they needed to keep viewers engaged around the clock, and the best way to do that was to morph journalism into a spectacle for entertainment. Something that describes real life but keeps its audience engaged like a daily soap opera. Social media was sold as a new way to connect with friends and share parts of your life, but truly was a new way to commodify free time and shortening attention spans. Social Media is now less about sharing photos or happenings in one's life, but has become a platform of spectacle for debate about everything from the biggest news stories to the minutiae of our contemporary culture. Debord says that at once, spectacle is society itself, part of society, and an instrument of unification, while at the same time recognizing that separation is part of the unity of the world and our social praxis. We unite in the hypnotic debate of whether the latest album or film is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ and whether politicians or political policy is going to be our salvation or our destruction. Our very lives have been co-opted to produce this spectacle of debate, and in doing so, have us feeling separated from life.

    <h1>Constituents of a theroy of the media</h1>
    <h2>by Hans Magnus Enzenberger</h2>
    <p>
        I have been reflecting about my own relationship with media while reading Enzenberger’s Constiuents of a theory of the media. As a child growing up in a small town, I felt like media was my window to the world and how I could explore and understand the world before having access to the freedom of an adult. I found an instiable curiosity for the world through media and when I was able, I decided to step away from books and screens to explore and see it for myself. It was around this time that I started to become more critical of many of the preconceived narratives that had helped shape my world view. I became wary of narratives that sought to paint things as ‘dangerous’ and seek the deeper reasoning for the fear, quickly coming to understand many have their own agendas when shaping the stories they wish to tell. Though I was becoming more politically minded, I found myself often surrounded by people who were not as critical or curious about who shaped the narratives the public consumed and why. My undergraduate film program was in the school of communications and worked frequently alongside the broadcast journalism students at Quinnipiac University. I found it admirable that these students were interested in telling a fact based stories but soon learned the truth was relative. Around 2016 (what happened that year?), I began to see that truth was not rigid like it’s definition would infer, but could be bent and shaped with enough power. Enzenberger’s notion that there is a liberal superstition of a pure, unmanipulated truth became an ironic truth in my eyes. I had lived most of my life believing that a majority believed in the hard truths like evolution, a spherical earth, vaccines save lives, but the revelation was that all things, even those observable with our own eyes, contain many different readings or narratives one could draw from them. I recently happened to be rewatching some of Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom on HBO and the exact tensions described by Enzenberger were being played out. While there is a group of journalists nobly attempting to be as objectively informative and human focused as possible in their coverage, the heavy hand of their corporate owners seeks to steer the audience focus in favor of their capitalist interests and maintaining a status quo. The free exchange of information and objectivity threatens those that seek to control the consciousness so they seek to maintain a system of non-reciprocal, false communication, that subjects the audience to be receivers only and little to no access to being in the position of transmitter.

    <h1>A Cyborg Manifesto</h1>
    <h2>by Donna Haraway</h2>
    <p>
        Donna Haraway's essay strikes at similar futurist themes around cyborgism that I have explored in another class. While previously seen as a part of science fiction, cyborgs are here already and shaping the future evolution of the human race. As Haraway notes, and as we have touched upon in response to previous readings like that of Bush’s As We May Think, burgeoning technologies need to be influenced not by the capitalists who wish to use them to maximize shareholder value and maintain a hierarchical status quo, but instead by those who wish to harness them for maximizing creativity and shaping a more egalitarian future. Cyborgism and biomedical body modification will likely face a similar reactionary reception as Artificial Intelligence if not influenced in a more socialist-feminist direction. While Artificial Intelligence is seen as bad for a myriad of reasons, the emergence of this technology would be much better received and perhaps welcomed if it were being used to help, not harm creatives, cause little to no environmental strain, and were not being pioneered by men who feel indifferent about the future of human existence. As Haraway forewarns, we must be vigilant with the integration of technologies within the human body and ensure that they are not used to reinforce a strict, gendered patriarchal praxis but rather to enhance the abilities to find creativity and equality in our world. A few examples of cyborg artists who are spearheading this new movement are Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas. Harbisson, a visual artist, was born color blind and had an ‘antenna’ installed in his head that senses color and interprets it as a sound. Moon Ribas is a performance artist and dancer that had sensors implanted in her feet that vibrate whenever there is an earthquake around the world. The intensity of the vibrations corresponds with the seismic levels of the earthquake and informs Ribas’s improvised performances. These artists show how we are capable of choosing our own evolution as humans by creating new senses, and that those choices can (and should) be used for additive practices for the world rather than something that may perpetuate harmful societal paradigms.

    <h1>Hamlet on the Holodeck</h1>
    <h2>Janet Murray</h2>
    <p>
        Interactive storytelling is already a large swath of the current media landscape. Mostly seen in video games, though there have been attempts to mainstream interactive films like Netflix’s Bandersnatch, which ultimately most audiences felt was unsuccessful. In the sense that Murray writes, Bandersnatch was an additive creation using filmmaking and a choose-your-own-adventure style structure to create something that was not entirely brand new. In the end, the limitations of resources needed for filmmaking limit the expansive nature with which Murray talks about expressive forms, which is perhaps why digital interactive storytelling feels much more accessible with video games. The recent release Baldur’s Gate III is an example that comes to mind, with which the player, or audience, has much more ability to steer a storyline as they wish. While The Sims is spoken about as a prime example of interactivity and player choice, there are still the constraints of its attempts to simulate ‘real life.’ Baldur’s Gate is set in a fantasy world where the focus is much more on shaping whether you choose a villainous or heroic story arc for your character through many decisions and interactions throughout your journey, and your ability to choose to romance certain characters and make a nemesis of others makes the story much more customizable and immersive. Though, of course, there are still limitations. No game has yet created the ability to generate landscapes, assets, or character models that are not precreated for the specific game. I suppose the next step in making these interactive games a true expressive form will be with the integration of generative artificial intelligence. I’m sure in the near future we will begin to see games that market themselves as open-world builders, where you can choose to customize anything from the world setting to the exact physical makeup of characters without the predetermination of game developers, but instead with the integrated use of generative AI technology. One iteration or playthrough of your game could be in a fantasy world as a knight slaying dragons and rescuing damsels in distress, and then the next could be in a technodystopian future as an alien invading Earth. This would allow for a massive expansion in storytelling possibilities and would be closest to Murray’s idea of an expressive form, however, it wouldn’t exactly be a utopian development for a number of reasons. The integration of AI would eliminate a vast number of creative jobs that many people need and would require large amounts of energy to constantly be creating new digital environments and assets for each individual player. And while the idea of deeper immersion in media consumption is a draw for many of the capitalists behind the biggest producers of media these days, the thought of something of this scale makes me think consumers would sink deeper into digital isolation and become even more separated and fractured from the real physical world we live in.

    <h1>Lo and Behold</h1>
    <h2>by Werner Herzog</h2>
    <p>
        In many ways, I feel privileged to have lived a short time before the internet was omnipresent. I remember life before smartphones had most everyone's brains hardwired into the web. There was a greater sense of connection in everyday life and interactions with people. I think this is perhaps amplified for me by the rose-colored lens of nostalgia for one's childhood, but I do think there has been a notable shift in human connectivity since the dawn of the digital connection era. In Werner Herzog’s Lo and Behold, we see the optimism of those who worked on creating and cultivating the technology that birthed the internet as we know it today, while being confronted with those who suffer from how dangerous its rapid expanse has become. The ability to connect with others virtually anywhere and have encyclopedic knowledge carried around with us everywhere, in our pockets, is truly a magnificent result of our technological revolution, but we often fail to see and understand how it can deeply hurt us at the same time. I think back to the misunderstood quote of my great-uncle’s, about how people do not need technology to be so deeply integrated into their lives, and that he perhaps had a vision of how destructive that could be to human life. The irony being that many of the machines he made and sold were used by the labs that made up the ARPA network, and what would eventually become the internet. My grandfather and great-uncle would refer to themselves as ‘inconspicuous consumers’ in that they were never much interested in driving flashy, expensive cars or wearing luxury goods like expensive watches or jewelry. Nowadays, the tech consumerism we live in has become so conspicuous that it feels as though the dynamic has flipped and the technology is now consuming us. Through social media, people have now become the products that corporations sell data on and, in turn, use that data to prey on the consumeristic drive of our hyper-aestheticized society. I wish these technologies, like the internet and AI, were built and utilized with the intention they are sold with, to assist people in making their lives easier and generating more time to be creative and enjoy their lives, the way Vannevar Bush would have liked, but instead it has been cultivated to be a capitalistic tool that spies and takes advantage of its users. In a more collective, socialist world, the internet may have been introduced with more safeguards and protections from predatory behaviors, but when the whole world begins to virtually shake hands, the brutality of the world comes to the forefront. While the internet has had its positive impacts on my life, I won’t forget the images I’ve seen, but perhaps would have never seen, since being on the internet. The abject violence I have seen because of the internet feels hardly worth keeping up-to-date on the news or keeping in touch with some high school friends while constantly being pushed to buy things I don’t really need.

    <h1>10 PRINT CHR$</h1>
    <h2>by Nick Montfort et al.</h2>
    <p>
        I’ll admit I have not given much thought about the role randomness has played in my life, both creatively and otherwise. Though, upon reflection, it has always been there, behind the scenes, playing its part. I think most prominently, towards the end of my undergrad experience, I needed a creative credit outside of my filmmaking courses, so I took an improv acting course and enjoyed and excelled with it to the point where I was advised by the teacher to continue with it after I graduated. Post-grad, I moved to New York and decided I wanted to take classes at the famed UCB theater. While I was mostly surrounded by actors in these classes, seeking extra training to put on their resumes, I was able to hold my own in most of the scenes we did. Improv feels a lot like 10 PRINT in that there are confinements and some rules that you ought to play by, but when you are given a random word to base a scene off of, and start to play with no script, it can feel like you are building the tracks for the rollercoaster as it is going. There is collaboration along the way, but you are rarely ever in sole control of exactly where the scene ends up going. These scenes that are constructed on the spot, out of thin air, also reflect something back to us about our personal histories and the culture we are surrounded by. Cultural references, whether subverting or reaffirming, often shape the base of what is humorous about a scene and what is referred to as the game. The game is what is unknown, but found collectively by those improvising, and when done well is what makes watching improvisation so compelling and enjoyable.

    <h1>Race After Technology</h1>
    <h2>by Ruha Benjamin</h2>
    <p>
        I think there is a public perception that the internet was a neutral space that has, since its founding, been occupied and colonized by patriarchal white supremacist ideas. I believe this is how it has always been. It has been baked into its inception. As we know from our previously exploration of ARPANET, lots of technologies that impact our lives today come from government research. This is partially because research and development require lots and lots of financial resources, which means they are often done by very wealthy corporations or the war machine faction of our government. These technologies are created by the very imperialist apparatus that perpetuates so much oppression and seeks to maintain a status quo system of hierarchical inequality. When we speak about decolonization, we think of changing our minds and culture, but do not take into account how the internet and our persistent daily use of technologies are an extension of our minds and culture that allowed for a colonized world to be built in the first place. Critical analysis is deeply needed when constructing these world-changing technologies, but is frequently tossed by the wayside and seen as superfluous or too costly to the capitalists' profit margins. A greater paradigm shift is needed in how we create and incorporate new technologies into our lives, but in the meantime, there are some tools and tech being created in the margins that can be used to subvert the techno-imperialist system our society operates under today. Apps and websites that crowdfund bail money or create heatmaps of white collar crime show us the blind spots in our technologized world that are systemically ignored or repressed. While we must be critical of the systems that exist and continue to perpetuate the inequities in our society, we must also be critical of what solutions are put forth and wary of the technological benevolence of what may be presented as a cure but ends up deepening the sickness of another area of our world. With a focus on justice and community, we can perhaps begin to heal a world divided by our use and dependence on technology.
