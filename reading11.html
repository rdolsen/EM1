I think there is a public perception that the internet was a neutral space that has, since its founding, been occupied and colonized by patriarchal white supremacist ideas. I believe this is how it has always been. It has been baked into its inception. As we know from our previously exploration of ARPANET, lots of technologies that impact our lives today come from government research. This is partially because research and development require lots and lots of financial resources, which means they are often done by very wealthy corporations or the war machine faction of our government. These technologies are created by the very imperialist apparatus that perpetuates so much oppression and seeks to maintain a status quo system of hierarchical inequality. When we speak about decolonization, we think of changing our minds and culture, but do not take into account how the internet and our persistent daily use of technologies are an extension of our minds and culture that allowed for a colonized world to be built in the first place. Critical analysis is deeply needed when constructing these world-changing technologies, but is frequently tossed by the wayside and seen as superfluous or too costly to the capitalists' profit margins. A greater paradigm shift is needed in how we create and incorporate new technologies into our lives, but in the meantime, there are some tools and tech being created in the margins that can be used to subvert the techno-imperialist system our society operates under today. Apps and websites that crowdfund bail money or create heatmaps of white collar crime show us the blind spots in our technologized world that are systemically ignored or repressed. While we must be critical of the systems that exist and continue to perpetuate the inequities in our society, we must also be critical of what solutions are put forth and wary of the technological benevolence of what may be presented as a cure but ends up deepening the sickness of another area of our world. With a focus on justice and community, we can perhaps begin to heal a world divided by our use and dependence on technology.
