<h1>Fourth Reading Response</h1>
<p>Our class readings so far have come from writers who lived before the technological revolution brought on by the advent of the internet, and yet they seem to have an eerie prescience of what our world would look like many decades later. Debord continues this by outlining spectacle in a way that seems a fitting description of our contemporary news and social media landscape. The emergence of 24-hour news television meant that they needed to keep viewers engaged around the clock, and the best way to do that was to morph journalism into a spectacle for entertainment. Something that describes real life but keeps its audience engaged like a daily soap opera. Social media was sold as a new way to connect with friends and share parts of your life, but truly was a new way to commodify free time and shortening attention spans. Social Media is now less about sharing photos or happenings in one's life, but has become a platform of spectacle for debate about everything from the biggest news stories to the minutiae of our contemporary culture. Debord says that at once, spectacle is society itself, part of society, and an instrument of unification, while at the same time recognizing that separation is part of the unity of the world and our social praxis. We unite in the hypnotic debate of whether the latest album or film is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ and whether politicians or political policy is going to be our salvation or our destruction. Our very lives have been co-opted to produce this spectacle of debate, and in doing so, have us feeling separated from life.</p>
