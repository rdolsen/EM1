    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p> New York City is at once the largest city in the country and feels small. With so many cultures, languages, and cuisines from around the globe, living here can feel like the world is at your fingertips. From the small spaces to the chance encounters of bumping into someone you know, New York is a big city in a small world. </p>
