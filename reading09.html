In many ways, I feel privileged to have lived a short time before the internet was omnipresent. I remember life before smartphones had most everyone's brains hardwired into the web. There was a greater sense of connection in everyday life and interactions with people. I think this is perhaps amplified for me by the rose-colored lens of nostalgia for one's childhood, but I do think there has been a notable shift in human connectivity since the dawn of the digital connection era. In Werner Herzog’s Lo and Behold, we see the optimism of those who worked on creating and cultivating the technology that birthed the internet as we know it today, while being confronted with those who suffer from how dangerous its rapid expanse has become. The ability to connect with others virtually anywhere and have encyclopedic knowledge carried around with us everywhere, in our pockets, is truly a magnificent result of our technological revolution, but we often fail to see and understand how it can deeply hurt us at the same time. I think back to the misunderstood quote of my great-uncle’s, about how people do not need technology to be so deeply integrated into their lives, and that he perhaps had a vision of how destructive that could be to human life. The irony being that many of the machines he made and sold were used by the labs that made up the ARPA network, and what would eventually become the internet. My grandfather and great-uncle would refer to themselves as ‘inconspicuous consumers’ in that they were never much interested in driving flashy, expensive cars or wearing luxury goods like expensive watches or jewelry. Nowadays, the tech consumerism we live in has become so conspicuous that it feels as though the dynamic has flipped and the technology is now consuming us. Through social media, people have now become the products that corporations sell data on and, in turn, use that data to prey on the consumeristic drive of our hyper-aestheticized society. I wish these technologies, like the internet and AI, were built and utilized with the intention they are sold with, to assist people in making their lives easier and generating more time to be creative and enjoy their lives, the way Vannevar Bush would have liked, but instead it has been cultivated to be a capitalistic tool that spies and takes advantage of its users. In a more collective, socialist world, the internet may have been introduced with more safeguards and protections from predatory behaviors, but when the whole world begins to virtually shake hands, the brutality of the world comes to the forefront. While the internet has had its positive impacts on my life, I won’t forget the images I’ve seen, but perhaps would have never seen, since being on the internet. The abject violence I have seen because of the internet feels hardly worth keeping up-to-date on the news or keeping in touch with some high school friends while constantly being pushed to buy things I don’t really need.
