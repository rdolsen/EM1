<h1>Tenth Reading Response</h1>
<p>I’ll admit I have not given much thought about the role randomness has played in my life, both creatively and otherwise. Though, upon reflection, it has always been there, behind the scenes, playing its part. I think most prominently, towards the end of my undergrad experience, I needed a creative credit outside of my filmmaking courses, so I took an improv acting course and enjoyed and excelled with it to the point where I was advised by the teacher to continue with it after I graduated. Post-grad, I moved to New York and decided I wanted to take classes at the famed UCB theater. While I was mostly surrounded by actors in these classes, seeking extra training to put on their resumes, I was able to hold my own in most of the scenes we did. Improv feels a lot like 10 PRINT in that there are confinements and some rules that you ought to play by, but when you are given a random word to base a scene off of, and start to play with no script, it can feel like you are building the tracks for the rollercoaster as it is going. There is collaboration along the way, but you are rarely ever in sole control of exactly where the scene ends up going. These scenes that are constructed on the spot, out of thin air, also reflect something back to us about our personal histories and the culture we are surrounded by. Cultural references, whether subverting or reaffirming, often shape the base of what is humorous about a scene and what is referred to as the game. The game is what is unknown, but found collectively by those improvising, and when done well is what makes watching improvisation so compelling and enjoyable.
