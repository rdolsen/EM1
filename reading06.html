<h1>Sixth Reading Response</h1>
<p>Donna Haraway's essay strikes at similar futurist themes around cyborgism that I have explored in another class. While previously seen as a part of science fiction, cyborgs are here already and shaping the future evolution of the human race. As Haraway notes, and as we have touched upon in response to previous readings like that of Bush’s As We May Think, burgeoning technologies need to be influenced not by the capitalists who wish to use them to maximize shareholder value and maintain a hierarchical status quo, but instead by those who wish to harness them for maximizing creativity and shaping a more egalitarian future. Cyborgism and biomedical body modification will likely face a similar reactionary reception as Artificial Intelligence if not influenced in a more socialist-feminist direction. While Artificial Intelligence is seen as bad for a myriad of reasons, the emergence of this technology would be much better received and perhaps welcomed if it were being used to help, not harm creatives, cause little to no environmental strain, and were not being pioneered by men who feel indifferent about the future of human existence. As Haraway forewarns, we must be vigilant with the integration of technologies within the human body and ensure that they are not used to reinforce a strict, gendered patriarchal praxis but rather to enhance the abilities to find creativity and equality in our world. A few examples of cyborg artists who are spearheading this new movement are Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas. Harbisson, a visual artist, was born color blind and had an ‘antenna’ installed in his head that senses color and interprets it as a sound. Moon Ribas is a performance artist and dancer that had sensors implanted in her feet that vibrate whenever there is an earthquake around the world. The intensity of the vibrations corresponds with the seismic levels of the earthquake and informs Ribas’s improvised performances. These artists show how we are capable of choosing our own evolution as humans by creating new senses, and that those choices can (and should) be used for additive practices for the world rather than something that may perpetuate harmful societal paradigms.</p>
